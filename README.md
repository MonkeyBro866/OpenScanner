# Open Scanner

Open Scanner is a fast, free document scanning app for iPhone. You can [download it from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6578414558).

## About the app

### What is Open Scanner?

Open Scanner scans your receipts, notes, textbooks, and anything else you point your iPhone at.

It saves your scans into its built-in library, and syncs them to all your devices.

Unlike other scanner apps, Open Scanner is free, and always will be: no ads, no in-app purchases, no subscriptions.

### Why should I trust Open Scanner?

Open Scanner is open source (MIT License). That means another app developer can take the source code and audit it, or republish it as their own app.

You can even run your own private version of Open Scanner on your iPhone, if youâ€™re adventurous.

### What permissions does Open Scanner ask for?

Open Scanner will prompt you for the following permissions:

 - **Camera**: Required for scanning your documents.
 - **Location**: Optional. If you grant location permission, Open Scanner will annotate your scans with location data.
